# QR-Gen-R 🧑‍💻
## Get on with it... 😒
Alright! But before that... you may check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/QR-Gen-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/QR-Gen-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/QR-Gen-R/). <br /> <br />
QR-Gen-R generates a QR code from a URL or string text of your desire. This may be downloaded by right clicking on the image and saving it (a button for this will be added). <br /> <br />
I used the Svelte framework to build the app, and the goqr.me API to generate the QR codes. Check it out here: https://goqr.me/api/.

## How to run? 😭
If you want to run it on your own, clone this repo into your machine and install the necessary dependencies by inputting the following code in the command line while in your cloned version: <br />

```
npm install
```

When that's done, input the following code and you're all good: <br />

```
npm run dev
